/*
Hardware Prerequisites:
=======================
USB lines D+ and D- MUST be wired to the same I/O port. Line D- MUST be wired
to bit number 0. D+ must also be connected to INT0. D- requires a pullup of
1.5k to +3.5V (and the device must be powered at 3.5V) to identify as
low-speed USB device. A pullup of 1M SHOULD be connected from D+ to +3.5V to
prevent interference when no USB master is connected. We use D+ as interrupt
source and not D- because it does not trigger on keep-alive and RESET states.

As a compile time option, the 1.5k pullup resistor on D- can be made
switchable to allow the device to disconnect at will. See the definition of
usbDeviceConnect() and usbDeviceDisconnect() further down in this file.

Please adapt the values in usbconfig.h according to your hardware!

The device MUST be clocked at 12 MHz. This is more than the 10 MHz allowed by
an AT90S2313 powered at 4.5V. However, if the supply voltage to maximum clock
relation is interpolated linearly, an ATtiny2313 meets the requirement by
specification. In practice, the AT90S2313 can be overclocked and works well.


Limitations:
============
Compiling:
You should link the usbdrv.o module first because it has special alignment
requirements for the receive buffer (the buffer must not cross a 256 byte
page boundary, it must not even touch it at the end). If you can't link it
first, you must use other measures to ensure alignment.
Note: gcc does not always assign variable addresses in the order as the modules
are linked or the variables are declared. You can choose a memory section for
the receive buffer with the configuration option "USB_BUFFER_SECTION". This
option defaults to ".bss". If you use your own section, you can place it at
an arbitrary location with a linker option similar to
"-Wl,--section-start=.mybuffer=0x800060". Use "avr-nm -ng" on the binary and
search for "usbRxBuf" to find tbe base address of the 22 bytes rx buffer.

Robustness with respect to communication errors:
The driver assumes error-free communication. It DOES check for errors in
the PID, but does NOT check bit stuffing errors, SE0 in middle of a byte,
token CRC (5 bit) and data CRC (16 bit). CRC checks can not be performed due
to timing constraints: We must start sending a reply within 7 bit times.
Bit stuffing and misplaced SE0 would have to be checked in real-time, but CPU
performance does not permit that. The driver does not check Data0/Data1
toggling, but application software can implement the check.

Sampling jitter:
The driver guarantees a sampling window of 1/2 bit. The USB spec requires
that the receiver has at most 1/4 bit sampling window. The 1/2 bit window
should still work reliably enough because we work at low speed. If you want
to meet the spec, define the macro "USB_CFG_SAMPLE_EXACT" to 1 in usbconfig.h.
This will unroll a loop which results in bigger code size.

Input characteristics:
Since no differential receiver circuit is used, electrical interference
robustness may suffer. The driver samples only one of the data lines with
an ordinary I/O pin's input characteristics. However, since this is only a
low speed USB implementation and the specification allows for 8 times the
bit rate over the same hardware, we should be on the safe side. Even the spec
requires detection of asymmetric states at high bit rate for SE0 detection.

Number of endpoints:
The driver supports up to two endpoints: One control endpoint (endpoint 0) and
one interrupt-in endpoint (endpoint 1) where the device can send interrupt
data to the host. Endpoint 1 is only compiled in if
USB_CFG_HAVE_INTRIN_ENDPOINT is defined to 1 in usbconfig.h.

Maximum data payload:
Data payload of control in and out transfers may be up to 254 bytes. In order
to accept payload data of out transfers, you need to implement
'usbFunctionWrite()'.

USB Suspend Mode supply current:
The USB standard limits power consumption to 500uA when the bus is in suspend
mode. This is not a problem for self-powered devices since they don't need
bus power anyway. Bus-powered devices can achieve this only by putting the
CPU in sleep mode. The driver does not implement suspend handling by itself.
However, the application may implement activity monitoring and wakeup from
sleep. The host sends regular SE0 states on the bus to keep it active. These
SE0 states can be detected by wiring the INT1 pin to D+. It is not necessary
to enable the interrupt, checking the interrupt pending flag should suffice.
Before entering sleep mode, the application should enable INT1 for a wakeup
on the next bus activity.

Operation without an USB master:
The driver behaves neutral without connection to an USB master if D- reads
as 1. To avoid spurious interrupts, we recommend a high impedance (e.g. 1M)
pullup resistor on D+. If D- becomes statically 0, the driver may block in
the interrupt routine.

Interrupt latency:
The application must ensure that the USB interrupt is not disabled for more
than 20 cycles. This implies that all interrupt routines must either be
declared as "INTERRUPT" instead of "SIGNAL" (see "avr/signal.h") or that they
are written in assembler with "sei" as the first instruction.

Maximum interrupt duration / CPU cycle consumption:
The driver handles all USB communication during the interrupt service
routine. The routine will not return before an entire USB message is received
and the reply is sent. This may be up to ca. 1200 cycles = 100us if the host
conforms to the standard. The driver will consume CPU cycles for all USB
messages, even if they address another (low-speed) device on the same bus.
